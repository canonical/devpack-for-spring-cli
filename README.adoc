= A CLI focused on developer productivity

== Build

NOTE: Use JDK17+

Normal build:
```
./gradlew clean build
```

Which you can then run with:
```
java -jar build/libs/devpack-for-spring-cli-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

=== Code Formatting

This project uses Spring Javaformat and is enabled by default.

Run individual tasks:

```
./gradlew checkFormat
./gradlew checkstyleMain
./gradlew checkstyleTest
./gradlew format
```

You can temporarily disable checks by setting property `cliChecks` to `false`:

```
./gradlew build -PcliChecks=false
```

=== Shell Completion

Shell completion for `bash` can be generated with `completion bash` command:

```
$ source <(devpack-for-spring completion bash)
```
